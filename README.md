Do you need to create a mobile app that opens an external url?
1) Download the source code.
2) Open src/app/app.component.ts.
3) Search this line "let url = 'http://example.com';" and replace http://example.com with your url.
4) Build from CLI with "ionic cordova run android" or "ionic cordova run ios".
5) Enjoy

Important: you need to install the ionic framework v2 environment in your development machine. More information at: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/.
